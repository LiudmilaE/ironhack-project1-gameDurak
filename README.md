DURAK (Russian: Дурак; IPA: [dʊˈrak] (About this sound listen), "fool")
 is a card game that is popular in post-Soviet states.

The object of the game is to get rid of all one's cards. At the end of the game, the last player with cards in their hand is the durak.

SETUP

The game is typically played with two to five people, using a deck of 36 cards. The deck is shuffled, and each player receives six cards. The bottom card of the remaining deck is laid open on the table. This determines the trump suit.
The remainder of the deck is then placed on top of the revealed card at a 90 degree angle, so that it remains visible, forming a draw pile called the prikup ("talon").
The revealed card remains part of the talon and is drawn as the last card. Cards discarded due to successful defenses are placed in a discard pile next to the talon.

GAMEPLAY
The player with the lowest trump is the first attacker. The player to the attacker's left is always the defender.
After each turn play proceeds clockwise. If the attack succeeds (see below), the defender loses their turn and the attack passes to the player on the defender's left. If the attack fails, the defender becomes the next attacker.

ATTACK
The attacker opens the turn by playing one card face up on the table as an attacking card. The player to the attacker's left is the defender.
In the basic podkidnoy (подкидной, "throw-in") variant, and in most other variants of durak, the defender has to immediately attempt defense in response to the initial attack.
Ace is the highest rank and six is the lowest. Trumps always beat non-trump cards regardless of rank (e.g., a trump six beats a non-trump ace).

DEFENSE
The defender attempts to beat the attacking cards by playing higher-valued defending cards from their hand. One card is played to defend against each attacking card, and it must be in the attacking card's suit or the trump suit.
At any point during a defense, all players other than the defender can add extra attacking cards, provided that for each new attacking card, there is already a card of the same rank on the table (either defending or attacking), and the total number of attacking cards does not exceed the number of cards in the defender's hand. The defender must also defend against these new cards. If at any point multiple players wish to add cards simultaneously, the first attacker has first priority, then the player to defender's left, and so forth clockwise.
This variant of game durak only allows cards to be added to the attack once the first defending card has been played.

At any point during the turn, a defender unwilling or unable to beat all attacking cards may abandon the defense by picking up all the cards on the table. This ends the turn. The failed defender loses their turn to attack; hence the player to the defender's left attacks next.
If, however, the defender has beaten all attacking cards, and no other players are willing or able to add more, the defender has triumphed. The turn ends, all cards on the table are placed in the discard pile, and play passes to the left: the successful defender opens the next turn as the new attacker.
No players may examine the discard pile at any point.

END OF TURN
At the end of each turn, whether or not the defense was successful, each player draws until they have six cards in their hand or the talon is exhausted. The main attacker draws as many cards as necessary first, followed by any other attackers in clockwise order, and finally the defender. Once the talon is empty, play continues without further drawing. Players who exhaust their hands leave the game.

WINNING AND LOSING
The last person left with cards in their hand is the loser (the fool or "durak").
In this variant of game durak there are no winners, only the loser.
